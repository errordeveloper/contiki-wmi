## platform alias (don't remove this line)

## This file can be sources from the shell
## to provide shordhand aliases for targets.
## Well, these are still quite long, but
## copletition can be used with ease.

## The idea is that the names with number
## at the end are refered to specific devices
## and do have a specific UDEV_UART, whlie
## the names without number are general.

## make.[]	make TARGET=[]		UDEV_UART=/dev/serial/by-id/
freescale-usb	freescale-1322xusb
f1		freescale-1322xusb	/dev/serial/by-id/usb-FTDI_FT232R_USB_UART_A50046Ij-if00-port0
econotag	redbee-econotag
e1		redbee-econotag		/dev/serial/by-id/usb-FTDI_Dual_RS232-HS-if01-port0
